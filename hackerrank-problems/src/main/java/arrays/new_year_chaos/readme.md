It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue. Initial positions increment by  from  at the front of the line to  at the back.

Any person in the queue can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions. If two people swap positions, they still wear the same sticker denoting their original places in line. One person can bribe at most two others. For example, if  and  bribes , the queue will look like this: .

Fascinated by this chaotic queue, you decide you must know the minimum number of bribes that took place to get the queue into its current state. If anyone has bribed more than two people, the line is too chaotic to compute the answer.

Explanation

Test Case 1

The initial state:

After person  moves one position ahead by bribing person :

pic2.png

Now person  moves another position ahead by bribing person :

pic3.png

And person  moves one position ahead by bribing person :

So the final state is  after three bribing operations.

Test Case 2

No person can bribe more than two people, yet it appears person  has done so. It is not possible to achieve the input state.
